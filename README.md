# Irish Constituencies Neo4j Database
###### Gareth Lynskey, G00312651

## Introduction
For my project I have to design a neo4j graph database of all the constituencies in the Republic of Ireland.

## Database
Explain how you created your database, and how information is represented in it.

## Queries
Summarise your three queries here.
Then explain them one by one in the following sections.

#### Query one title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query two title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query three title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```
